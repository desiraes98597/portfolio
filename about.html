        <h4>I spent time from 2008-2010 going to school and getting a web design certificate.</h4> 
        <p>Graduated with honors, but got cold feet. </p>
        <p>Everyone around me was young and seemed so much better than me. I suffered from imposter syndrome, big time. 
            So instead of looking for working in the field I passionately loved, I took some time to recharge and ended up living and 
            working in Yellowstone for 3 years. Coming home to Seattle, I found a job at Amazon, and basically did not code again until
            6 months ago. </p>
         <p>I consider myself very lucky to be in a role at work where I have the flexibility to try new things. I started coding again 
             and remember how much I loved it. So here I am, trying to update some very outdated skills, and learn javascript, which in 2010 
             was not really taught for web design.
